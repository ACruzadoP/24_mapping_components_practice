/* 
Given a list of products (as an array of objects, as seen in productsData.js)
render a Product component (which you'll also need to create) for each
product in the list.
<br />
<br />
Make sure to use the array's `.map()` method to create these components, and 
don't forget to pass a `key` prop to it to avoid the warning.
